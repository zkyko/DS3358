1A)	A car parking management system is designed to manage a reserved parking spot, possibly for an apartment complex or valet service. Vehicles are assigned a specific spot when they first arrive, and keep that spot if they return. The primary goal is to streamline the parking process by assigning new cars to an individual spot, and the same spot whenever they return. 

1B)	The system can be conceptualized using an array of strings, where each spot in the array represents a parking spot, and the string in the spot is the license plate number of the assigned car. When a car comes to the garage, the system checks if they have an assigned spot. If they do, then nothing changes in the array. If not, the system assigns then the next available spot, (unless all spots have been reserved already).
